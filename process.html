            <h2>Pouches</h2>
            <p>The idea from the pouches started with this series of paper pouches that I folded from basic A4 paper.
                Here the main idea was that anyone could fold themselves a quick nice mask pouch. After discussing our
                progress with Ingeborg however, she advised us that we have to take into consideration that people are
                less worried about littering if a material is considered cheap. We also considered biodegradable
                materials to make our product more circular, but it’s not always better if you need something long
                lasting. We learned that in the Netherlands we don’t have the systems in place for degradable materials
                like banana leaves.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/pp.png" alt="Paper pouches">

            <p>For our second iteration we decided to continue with fabric, both because this is the material I am most
                familiar with as a fashion designer, and because we felt it would give a more appealing feel to the
                pouches, so people wouldn’ want to throw them away. We also needed a way to distinguish between the
                different pouches for the different days, so before we came up with the planetary concept, we tried some
                colorful gradients. I used the sublimation printer at my work to print on polyester fabric.
